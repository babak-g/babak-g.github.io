      <h1>Lahjay — Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 27, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Lahjay (the “App”) is a personal Persian‑language learning application
        operated by Lahjay Company (“we,” “us,” or “our”). Your privacy is
        important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we
        collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have. By
        using Lahjay, you agree to the collection and use of information in
        accordance with this Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Information you provide</em> – When you create or import flashcards
        or contact us, you may provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Content you add to the App (e.g., text or images on flashcards).
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional account or contact details (such as email) if you choose to
          sync decks or request support.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Automatically collected information</em> – Through Apple‑provided
        analytics and diagnostics (if you opt in), we receive anonymized,
        aggregated data about crashes, feature usage, and device information
        (e.g., model, iOS version). This data cannot identify you personally.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide, maintain, and improve Lahjay’s features, including the
          Leitner review system, token management, and local progress tracking.
        </li>
        <li>Respond to support inquiries or feedback you send us.</li>
        <li>
          Monitor and analyze App performance, crashes, and usage trends to
          improve stability and usability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Third‑Party Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your personal data. We share
        information only:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          With service providers who process data on our behalf in compliance
          with this Policy (e.g., Apple iCloud if you enable iCloud backup).
        </li>
        <li>When required by law, subpoena, or other legal process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Your flashcard decks and progress remain on your device and in your
        private iCloud storage (if enabled) until you delete them or uninstall
        the App. Crash logs and analytics retained by Apple follow Apple’s
        standard retention schedules.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your
        information, including iOS sandboxing and Apple‑managed encryption for
        any iCloud data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure;
        therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Lahjay is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided
        us personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct,
        delete, or restrict the processing of your personal information. To
        exercise these rights, contact us using the details below.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes take effect
        when posted within the App or at
        <a href="https://babak-g.github.io">our website</a>. Material changes
        will be announced in‑App. Please review periodically.
